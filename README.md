# Python Doubt Solver Bot

This Python Doubt Solver Bot is designed to assist users in resolving their queries related to Python programming. It utilizes natural language processing (NLP) techniques to understand user inputs and provide relevant responses.

Getting Started
To get started with the Python Doubt Solver Bot, follow these instructions:

Clone the repository or download the source code files.
Ensure you have the necessary Python libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
bash
Copy code
pip install numpy scikit-learn nltk
Download NLTK data by uncommenting the following lines in the code and running it:
python
Copy code
nltk.download('punkt') # first-time use only
nltk.download('wordnet') # first-time use only
Prepare your corpus by creating a text file named corpus.txt containing a collection of Python-related texts.

Run the Python script python_doubt_solver_bot.py.

Functionality
The Python Doubt Solver Bot provides the following functionality:

Greeting: Responds to user greetings such as "hello", "hi", and "hey".
Response Generation: Generates responses to user queries using cosine similarity between TF-IDF vectors.
Preprocessing: Performs tokenization, lemmatization, and normalization of user inputs.
Keyword Matching: Matches user inputs with predefined greeting inputs.
Exiting: Allows users to exit the conversation by typing "bye".
Usage
Once the bot is running, users can interact with it by typing their doubts or questions about Python programming. The bot will analyze the input and provide appropriate responses based on the provided corpus.

Example Interaction
bash
Copy code
ROBO: My name is Robo. I will answer your queries about Python. If you want to exit, type Bye!
Your Doubt: How can I create a function in Python?
ROBO: A function in Python can be created using the def keyword followed by the function name and parameters.
Your Doubt: What are the benefits of using NumPy?
ROBO: NumPy offers benefits such as efficient numerical computation, support for multi-dimensional arrays, and a wide range of mathematical functions.
Your Doubt: Bye
ROBO: Bye! take care..
