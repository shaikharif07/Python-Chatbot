# Python-Chatbot


This is a readme file and the main motive of it is to explain the how to run the code and the use of files present here.
So there are two file one is a python file named chatbot.py which contain the code of my project and the other is corpus.txt which 
is basicly a raw training data which contain the responses to the user's doubt. The corpus is then imported to the python code usin the concept of file handling.
